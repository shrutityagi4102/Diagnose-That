## Introduction

Our web app aims to predict whether the user has a certain disease or not. The prediction will be done on the basis of general questions asked in the form of multiple-choice questions. Some models will also be based on the X-ray and scan images provided by the users. The user can choose among 6 diseases and on choosing a certain disease general
information about that disease and informative facts are provided to the user.
